Problem Statement:
Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to 
make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping. Note that intervals which only touch at a point are non-overlapping. For example, [1, 2] and [2, 3] are non-overlapping.
 
Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.\

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Example 3:
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.



class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        int n = intervals.length;
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]));

        int prev = 0;
        int count = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (intervals[i][0] >= intervals[prev][1]) {
                prev = i;
                count++;
            }
        }
        return n - count;
    }
}



Total Time Complexity
- Sorting: O(n log n)
- Iterating: O(n)
- Overall: O(n log n) (Sorting dominates)

Space Complexity Analysis
- Sorting is done in-place, so it uses O(1) extra space.
- No extra data structures are used, except for a few integer variables (prevEnd, count).
- Total space complexity is O(1).

Final Complexity Summary
- Time Complexity: (O(n log n))
- Space Complexity: (O(1)) (constant space)
