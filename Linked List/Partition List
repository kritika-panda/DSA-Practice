Partitioning a linked list around a given value and keeping the original order
Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come first, then all nodes with a 
value equal to x, and finally nodes with a value greater than x. The original relative order of the nodes in each of the three 
partitions should be preserved.

Examples: 

Input : 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 2 -> 3, x = 3
Output: 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
Explanation: In the below linked list, all nodes with value less than 3 are on the left and rest of the nodes on the right by maintaining the relative order.
 
Input: 10 -> 4 -> 20 -> 10 -> 3, x = 3
Output: 3 -> 10 -> 4 -> 20 -> 10

// Java program to partition a linked list
// around a given value.

class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        next = null;
    }
}

class GfG {

    static Node partition(Node head, int x) {
        // Dummy head for nodes less than x
        Node lessHead = new Node(0);

        // Dummy head for nodes equal to x
        Node equalHead = new Node(0);

        // Dummy head for nodes greater than or equal to x
        Node greaterHead = new Node(0);

        Node less = lessHead;
        Node equal = equalHead;
        Node greater = greaterHead;

        Node curr = head;

        while (curr != null) {
            if (curr.data < x) {
                less.next = curr;
                less = less.next;
            } else if (curr.data == x) {
                equal.next = curr;
                equal = equal.next;
            } else {
                greater.next = curr;
                greater = greater.next;
            }
            curr = curr.next;
        }

        // Connect the partitions together
        greater.next = null;

        // Connect equal to greater
        equal.next = greaterHead.next;

        // Connect less to equal
        less.next = equalHead.next;

        // New head of the rearranged list
        Node newHead = lessHead.next;

        return newHead;
    }

    static void printList(Node head) {
        Node curr = head;
        while (curr != null) {
            System.out.print(curr.data + " ");
            curr = curr.next;
        }
        System.out.println();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating the linked list: 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 2
        Node head = new Node(1);
        head.next = new Node(4);
        head.next.next = new Node(3);
        head.next.next.next = new Node(2);
        head.next.next.next.next = new Node(5);
        head.next.next.next.next.next = new Node(2);
		int x = 3;
        head = partition(head, x);
        printList(head);
    }
}


Output
1 2 2 3 4 5 
Time complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
