Problem Statement: Given a string, S. Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.



class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int n=s.length();
        int l=0,r=0;
        int maxi=0;
        HashMap<Character,Integer> hm=new HashMap<>();
        while(r<n)
        {
            char m=s.charAt(r);
            if(hm.containsKey(m))
                l=Math.max(l,hm.get(m)+1);   // example: "abba"
            maxi=Math.max(maxi,r-l+1);
            hm.put(m,r);
            r++;
        }
        return maxi;
    }
}
